  "title": "The Law of Least Effort",
  "summary": "Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort: we naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work. To build good habits, reduce the friction associated with them. To break bad habits, increase the friction. Make it easy to do the right thing and hard to do the wrong thing.",
  "keyIdeas": [
    "We naturally choose the path of least resistance.",
    "Reduce friction to make good habits easier.",
    "Increase friction to make bad habits harder.",
    "Environment design can make or break a habit.",
    "The less energy a habit requires, the more likely it is to occur.",
    "Prime your environment to make good habits effortless.",
    "Small reductions in friction can lead to significant behavior changes."
