  "title": "The Best Way to Start a New Habit",
  "summary": "Implementation intentions and habit stacking are powerful strategies for starting new habits. By linking new behaviors to specific cues and existing routines, you make habits more automatic and easier to remember. The key is to be specific about when and where you'll perform your new habit.",
  "keyIdeas": [
    "Implementation intentions use the formula: 'I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].'",
    "Habit stacking links new habits to existing ones using: 'After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].'",
    "Specificity increases the likelihood of following through.",
    "The best time to start a habit is now, not when conditions are perfect.",

    "Stacking habits creates a chain reaction of positive behaviors.",
    "The more specific your plan, the more automatic your habit becomes."
