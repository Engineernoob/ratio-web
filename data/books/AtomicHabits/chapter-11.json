  "summary": "Progress requires consistency, not perfection. The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning. Focus on taking action, even if it's small. Repetition, not intensity, is what makes habits stick. Start small and build momentum over time.",
  "keyIdeas": [
    "Motion vs. action: planning is motion, doing is action.",
    "Repetition is more important than perfection when building habits.",
    "Start small and build momentum—walk slowly, but never backward.",
    "The best habit is the one you can actually stick to.",
    "Consistency beats intensity in the long run.",
    "Focus on showing up, not on being perfect.",
    "Small actions compound into significant results over time."

  "examples": [
    "Doing 1 push-up daily is better than planning an elaborate workout you never do.",
    "Reading 1 page per day beats reading 50 pages once and then stopping.",
    "Meditating for 1 minute daily is more valuable than 30 minutes once a month."
  ],
  "exercises": [
    "Shrink a habit you want to build to a 2-minute version.",
    "Identify one habit where you're stuck in planning mode—take action today.",
    "Commit to showing up for a habit daily, even if it's just for 1 minute."

  "reflections": [
    "Where are you planning instead of practicing?",
    "What habit could you start today if you made it small enough?"
