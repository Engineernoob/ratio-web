      "prompt": "All philosophers are seekers of truth. Socrates is a philosopher. Therefore:",
      "choices": [
        "Socrates seeks truth",
        "Socrates is not a seeker of truth",
        "All seekers of truth are philosophers",
        "None of the above"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "This is a valid categorical syllogism. The major premise states all philosophers are truth-seekers. The minor premise identifies Socrates as a philosopher. The conclusion follows necessarily: Socrates seeks truth."

      "id": "fallacy-1",
      "type": "mcq",

      "prompt": "Complete the sequence: 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, ?",
      "answer": "42",
      "explanation": "The pattern is n(n+1): 1×2=2, 2×3=6, 3×4=12, 4×5=20, 5×6=30, so 6×7=42."

      "prompt": "If the ratio of A to B is 3:4, and B is 16, what is A?",
      "answer": "12",
      "explanation": "If A:B = 3:4, then A = (3/4) × B. Given B = 16, A = (3/4) × 16 = 12."

      "answer": 3,
      "explanation": "From 'all X are Y' and 'some Y are Z', we cannot determine the relationship between X and Z. The X that are Y might or might not be among the Y that are Z."

      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Valid categorical syllogism. If no birds are mammals, and all eagles are birds, then no eagles can be mammals."
