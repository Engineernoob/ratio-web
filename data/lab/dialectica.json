    "One might argue that knowledge and virtue are distinct: a person can understand what is right yet still choose wrong. This suggests knowledge alone is insufficient for virtue.",
    "Another perspective: virtue requires not just knowing the good, but also the will and habit to act upon it. Knowledge is necessary but not sufficient.",
    "A counterargument: if virtue is knowledge, then all wrongdoing is ignorance. But we observe people who seem to know better yet act poorly—how do we explain this?"
