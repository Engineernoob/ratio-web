    "prompt": "All philosophers are thinkers. Some thinkers are logicians. Therefore, all philosophers are logicians. Is this argument valid?",
    "solution": "No, this is invalid. The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises establish that philosophers are a subset of thinkers, and that some thinkers are logicians, but this does not guarantee that all philosophers are logicians. This is a fallacy of the undistributed middle term.",
    "explanation": [
      "Premise 1: All philosophers are thinkers (universal affirmative).",
      "Premise 2: Some thinkers are logicians (particular affirmative).",
      "The middle term 'thinkers' is not distributed in the second premise.",
      "For a valid syllogism, the middle term must be distributed in at least one premise.",
      "Therefore, the conclusion does not follow logically."
